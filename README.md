# Gesture Detection

A simple neural network model was developed to classify hand gestures between the numbers one to five based on the number of fingers that are being held up. You can use this repository to train your own gesture classification model:

- gesture_data_collection.ipynb explains explains how to collect and save the training data for the gestures.
- gesture_train_model.ipynb explains how to use the data to train the model and test its performance using your webcam.

## Result

ToDo: Add gif

## Example training data:

Google's Mediapipe library was used to record coordinate positions of 21 landmark keypoints that describe the shape of the hand. These values were saved in csv files and used to train the model.

ToDo: Add training data images
